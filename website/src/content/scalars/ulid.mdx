# ULID

The `ULID` scalar type represents a Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier as
defined by the [ULID specification](https://github.com/ulid/spec). ULIDs are 26-character strings
that are URL-safe, case-insensitive, and lexicographically sortable, making them ideal for
distributed systems requiring time-ordered unique identifiers.
